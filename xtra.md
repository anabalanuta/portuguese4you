 <h3> Learn Portuguese online </h3>
 I really recommend Duolingo, not only for Portuguese, but also for some other languages! It is one of the most popular websites for learning a language, alongside Memrise. It is free and very simple to use! Each language course is made up of many different modules and lessons, and you will need to complete each lesson before proceeding to the next! Also, the website tracks your daily progress, so that you have an idea of what your level should be! If you are looking to learn more, it is a great idea.
